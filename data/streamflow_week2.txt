I approached the homework for this next week 9/4/23 - 9/10/23 the same way as last week. I took the average of each previous week from
the previous years are got a cfs of 167.2167. This also includes the previous week since there is no current/future data for this week.
I also got 181.2676 for the following week 9/11/2023 - 9/17/2023.
