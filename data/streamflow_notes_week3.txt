This week the class used python to calculate the streamflow for this week 9/10 - 9/16 and next week. 
I used the code:
for i in range(len(flow)):
        if month[i] == 9 and day[i] >= 10 and day[i]<= 16:
                ilist.append(i)

subset = [flow[j] for j in ilist]
print(np.median(subset))

This gave me the median flow for all the previous years (since 1989) up to this year in order to find the median
flow which should be more accurate than the mean flow which I have been using so far. The value I got was 128.

I just ran a different cell to calculate the follwoing week.
# %%
for i in range(len(flow)):
        if month[i] == 9 and day[i] >= 17 and day[i]<= 23:
                ilist.append(i)


print(len(ilist))

subset = [flow[j] for j in ilist]



print(np.median(subset)) 

I got 118 for the 9/17 - 9/24 week.
